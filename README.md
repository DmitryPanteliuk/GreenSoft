Smart greenhouse system

The smart greenhouse system is designed to grow exotic small plants, or plants with strict microclimate criteria.
Management occurs through the server using the MQTT protocol
The greenhouse can be controlled by:

in manual mode;
automatic mode of maintaining the set temperature and coherence;
automatic climate control for plants;

We can control watering, amount of light, temperature, humidity, ventilation, temperature.

This development went to competitions in Moldova, but unfortunately did not take a prize place since we did not know the competition topics (the topic was bioengineering).
